def general_ghz_state(qubits):
    r"""
    Circuit that prepare a general GHZ State based on zero state.

    The GHZ State is defined as the equality superposition of three zeros state
    and three ones state:

    .. math::

        \left|\text{GHZ}\right> = (\left|000\right> + \left|111\right>)/\sqrt{2}

    Here in this API, we can create a general GHZ state on arbitrary sub qubits of
    any total qubits.

    Args:
        qubits (list[int]): Qubits you want to apply general GHZ state.

    Returns:
        Circuit, circuit that can prepare ghz state.

    Examples:
        >>> from quafu.algorithm.library import general_ghz_state
        >>> print(general_ghz_state(range(3)).get_qs(ket=True))
        √2/2¦000⟩
        √2/2¦111⟩
        >>> print(general_ghz_state([1, 2]).get_qs(ket=True))
        √2/2¦000⟩
        √2/2¦110⟩
