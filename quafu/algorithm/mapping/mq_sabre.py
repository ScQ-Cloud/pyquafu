    QUAFUSABRE algorithm to implement qubit mapping.

    This mapping alrogrthm considered the cnot error and executing time in quantum chip.

    Args:
        circuit (:class:`~.core.circuit.Circuit`): The quantum circuit you need to do qubit mapping. Currently we only
            support circuit constructed by one or two qubits gate, control qubit included.
        topology (:class:`~.device.QubitsTopology`): The hardware qubit topology. Currently we only support
            connected coupling graph.
        cnoterrorandlength (List[Tuple[Tuple[int, int], List[float]]]): The error and gate length of a cnot gate. The
            first two integers are qubit node id in topology. The list of float has two element, with first one be the
            error of cnot and second one be the gate length.

    Examples:
        >>> from quafu.algorithm.mapping import QUAFUSABRE
        >>> cnot=[((5, 6), [8.136e-4, 248.88]), ((6, 10), [9.136e-4, 248.88]), ((8, 9), [9.136e-4, 248.88])]
        >>> topology = GridQubits(6,6)
        >>> quafusaber = QUAFUSABRE(circuit, topology, cnot)
        >>> new_circ, init_mapping, final_mapping = masaber.solve(1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1)
