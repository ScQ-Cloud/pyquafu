class InteractionOperator(PolynomialTensor):
    r"""
    Class to store 'interaction opeartors' which are used to configure a ferinonic molecular Hamiltonian.

    The Hamiltonian including one-body and two-body terms which conserve spin
    and parity. In this module, the stored coefficient could be represented the
    molecular Hamiltonians through the FermionOperator class.

    Note:
        The operators stored in this class has the form:

        .. math::

            C + \sum_{p, q} h_{[p, q]} a^\dagger_p a_q +
            \sum_{p, q, r, s} h_{[p, q, r, s]} a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_r a_s.

        Where :math:`C` is a constant.

    Args:
        constant (numbers.Number): A constant term in the operator given as a
                float. For instance, the nuclear repulsion energy.
        one_body_tensor (numpy.ndarray): The coefficients of the one-body terms (h[p, q]).
            This is an :math:`n_\text{qubits}\times n_\text{qubits}` numpy array of floats.
            By default we store the numpy array with keys: :math:`a^\dagger_p a_q` (1,0).
        two_body_tensor (numpy.ndarray): The coefficients of the two-body terms
            (h[p, q, r, s]). This is an
            :math:`n_\text{qubits}\times n_\text{qubits}\times n_\text{qubits}\times n_\text{qubits}`
            numpy array of floats.By default we store the numpy array
            with keys: :math:`a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_r a_s` (1, 1, 0, 0).
