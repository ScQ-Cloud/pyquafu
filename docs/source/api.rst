API
===

API of the Python and C++ code of quafu.
To have a Python frontend and C++ in the backend,
we make use of `Pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/>`_.
The C++ code represents quantum circuits with the help of
`Tweedledum <https://github.com/boschmitt/tweedledum>`_ networks, which can
also be turned into directed acyclic graphs
(`DAG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_),
to make some operations more efficient.
